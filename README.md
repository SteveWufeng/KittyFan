# KittyFan
POV(persistence of vision) display. My first personal big project.

This repository contains:
- simulation for the POV display
- test for displaying only text spining
- actual code to run on POV display.
- 3D printing items to assemple the hardwares
- PCB circuit for slipring

# Materials:
- powerful DC Motor
- 2 LED strip 72 LEDs 0.5 meter length.
- Raspberry pi
- power supply 19v 2A for motor, 5v 1A for led, 5v 2A for raspberry pi
- slipring (see slipring folder)

# Software used during development:
- Kicad : for PCB design
- 123D : 3d modeling
- VScode and VIM : programing
- Github : for backup code

# Libraries used
- time
- rpi_ws281x
- argparse
- cv2
- math
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot (needed for simulation only)

# Things I learned while doing this project
- Kicad software for building basic PCB
- Hand on experience with 3d printer and 3d modeling
- Basic circuit building and basic electrical knowledge
- Programming LED strip
- Experience with applying calcusus and other math knowledge for algorithm and logic.
